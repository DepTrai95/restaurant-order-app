# My Vite-powered Restaurant-Order-Application

This is a template created from me, so that in the future I can have quick restaurant-ordering-applications. It is using Vue 3 with Vite and PrimeVue as UI-Library. I was using the Options API here, as it was easier to get used to Vue.js and is preferred for rather small applications like this one.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
