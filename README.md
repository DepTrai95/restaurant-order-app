# restaurant-order-app (unfinished/obsolete)

- This is an unfinished project, the idea was an ordering-application a lot of people might've seen in restaurants/caf√©'s using Vue in the Frontend and Firebase as PaaS as at the time of starting this hobby project I had absolutely no experience in Backend-Development at all. 
- Unfortunately the Document-based Database of Firestore is not useful/practicable for this kind of application and I started this project anew.
- Stopped this project at the point, where a user could add food/drink-items to the cart
- This time I will use **Nest.js for the Backend** with **Postgresql as the Database**.
